# Bootstrap-Portfolio using Bootstrap

Porftolio website created using mostly Bootstrap which was customised. I've learned some
new things about CSS doing this Project.v

# Project Description


    Create a new GitHub repository and name it Bootstrap-Portfolio.

    Clone this repository to your computer.

    Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create the folder structure for the webpage.

        Create a folder structure.

            Create a index.html.

            Create a css folder.

            Inside create a style.css file.

        Create an images folder.
            Place all your images in this folder.

    Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

        A navigation bar

        A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, 
        or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.

            Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.

            Links should navigate to the appropriate sections

        A hero section
            A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

        A work section

            A section displaying your work in grid.

            If you need to use placeholder image use placehold.co

            Use Bootstrap cards for each project.

            The description should give a brief overview of the work.

            Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

        A skills section
            List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

        An about/contact section
            An About Me section in the same row.

        A footer section

            All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

            All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

    Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

    Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
